// A codex entry can carry one raster image, stored inline on the entry as a
// data: URI — the same trick ship art uses for its SVGs (see lib/shipArt.js), so
// the picture rides the ordinary per-entity Firebase write and needs no separate
// Storage bucket or upload plumbing (Cloud Storage requires the paid Blaze plan;
// this keeps image uploads working on the free Spark plan).
//
// The catch raster brings that SVG doesn't: a phone photo is megabytes, the whole
// sector lives in memory and is diffed on every save, and RTDB is world-readable.
// So a picked file is never stored as-is. processImage downscales it to a sane
// maximum dimension and re-encodes to WebP (which keeps transparency and is far
// smaller than PNG/JPEG), bringing a page image down to tens of KB. Anything still
// over the cap after that is rejected with a clear message rather than quietly
// bloating the database.
//
// SECURITY: the stored value is only ever shown through <img src="data:…">, which
// renders image bytes and nothing else — it will not run scripts even though the
// database path is world-writable. Do not switch to any HTML/inline render.
